#  About Me:

I am Khalil , LLM Engineer & Senior Data Scientist with a strong foundation in mathematics. Specialized in building production-ready AI systems using NLP, intelligent agents, and machine learning.

Experienced in fine-tuning transformer models, designing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, and deploying scalable AI solutions. I bridge research rigor and engineering execution across deep learning and symbolic reasoning.

Outside of work, I am a competitive chess player, a music enthusiast, and a Formula 1 fan.
